Unfortunately, I think that that the management of the GPS coordinates is beyond my current knowledge and intent of this assignment.

Value proposition to the user - 
1) What geographic areas are "busy" for Uber drivers?

Potential algorithms -
1) What areas are have the most ride requests during this time of this day of the week, with recent days having a higher weight.
2) What areas have had the highest ride requests in the last 30 minutes?

API data needed
1) Ride origins
2) Ride start date/time
3) JSONP or CORS-enabled
